# Experiment 10(a): AVL Tree

## Aim
To write a Python program to construct an AVL tree and print the nodes of it using the appropriate packages and built-in functions.

---

## Algorithm

1. Start the program.# Exp No : 16
# AVL tree

## AIM :

To construct an AVL tree using the elements 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 25, and print the nodes using appropriate built-in functions.

## ALGORITHM :

Step 1: Define a class for AVL tree nodes that includes data, height, left, and right pointers.

Step 2: Implement AVL tree insertion which maintains the height-balanced property.

Step 3: Define utility functions such as:

a) Getting height of a node.

b) Right and left rotations. c] Getting balance factor.

Step 4: Insert the elements: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 25.

Step 5: Perform an in-order traversal to print the nodes of the AVL tree.

## PROGRAM:

```
from TreeAVL.AVL import AVL  

def getDictTree(self):
 return self.dict_tree

def Construct_AVL(L):
    tree=AVL(L)
    print(getDictTree(tree))
L=[10 ,20, 30, 40, 50, 25]
```

## OUTPUT :

## RESULT :

Thus the construction an AVL tree using the elements 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 25, and print the nodes using appropriate built-in functions was successfully executed.

 dictionary representation of an AVL tree.
3. Define a function `Construct_AVL(L)` to:
   - Create an AVL tree from the list `L`.
   - Get and print the dictionary tree using `getDictTree(tree)`.
4. Define a list `L` with integer values.
5. Call `Construct_AVL(L)` to build the tree and print the result.
6. End the program.
